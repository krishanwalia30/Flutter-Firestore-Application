This flutter project is an example of integration of Flutter with Firebase Firestore. It is a simple app that stores the data of products (such as productName, productPrice, imgUrl and isFavourite) in the Firestore. It performs all the CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations in realtime.

## Functionalities of the project

1. The user can add the product details in the Firestore with simple UI.
2. The app retrieves the data from the Firestore and displays in the Homepage of the App.
3. The user can mark the products as their favourite or not.
4. The user can delete the products from the App itself.
